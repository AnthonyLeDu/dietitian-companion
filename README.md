# dietitian-companion

## Purpose

This is a project aimed at practising back-end development (and maybe later front-end as well).

## Features

The project is composed of two databases :
- One coming from the Anses Ciqual database (https://ciqual.anses.fr)
- One managin patients and journals (see below)

The goal is to allow dietitians to create and fill patient's journals, which are the list of all food and drinks the patient ate during a given period (usually one week).

Using the nutrional information of the Ciqual database, the application will show to the dietitian what is the nutritional balance of his/her patient and how it compares with the recommanded balance (given the patient's gender, age and weight).
